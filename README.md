#  AWS-Patch-Manager-Control
AWS Patch Manager - AWS Resources. This repo contains AWS Resources and configurations that will help you manage the patching activities of EC2 instances


# Key Components
IAM Roles & Policies: These govern permissions for Patch Manager and Maintenance Window tasks.
SNS Notifications: Used to send patching status updates.
Patch Baseline & Groups: Define the patching rules for Amazon Linux 2 instances.
Maintenance Windows: Scheduled tasks for patch scans and installations using cron expressions, ensuring regular updates without manual intervention.

# How It Works 
Patch Baseline - This defines approved patches, installation rules, and compliance levels.
Maintenance Window-The window during which patches are applied, configurable via variables.tf.
Tag-Based Targeting- Instances tagged with a specific PatchGroup are automatically included for patching.
The repository integrates seamlessly into AWS environments using Terraform for infrastructure as code. 
Simply set up the required variables, apply Terraform, and let AWS take over the heavy lifting of patch management. 

# Two primary tasks 
Patch Scanning- Periodically checks instances for missing updates.
Patch Installation- Installs updates based on the predefined schedule.
Repository Structure:
main.tf- Core Terraform configurations for AWS Patch Manager.
variables.tf- Parameterizes the maintenance window schedule and other key details.
outputs.tf- Displays key outputs such as the SNS topic and maintenance window IDs.

# Setting Up
Clone the repository.
Customize the variables.tf file to match your EC2 patching needs (e.g., cron schedule, tags).
Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.
terraform init
terraform apply
Once deployed, the setup will continuously manage patching without manual oversight, ensuring your instances are always up-to-date with minimal intervention.

# END 
This repo simplifies AWS EC2 patching with automation, leveraging Amazon Web Services native tools and IaC practices. 
For any robust and smart solution, for patch management, this project is designed to save time and reduce operational risk and other security issues. 

Check out the repository here to get started with automating EC2 patching today!

Change Control & Emergency Patching
Normal changes: Raised via ITSM; CAB approval required for Prod.

Emergency (zero-day/exploited): Security may invoke Emergency Change; notify CAB within 24h; retrospective post-incident review required.

Rollback: Pre-change snapshot/AMI; documented rollback steps; automated validation gates (health checks).

## Exceptions & Risk Acceptance
Submit exception with: business justification, affected assets, compensating controls (WAF, isolation, IPS rules), and target remediation date.

Expiry: Max 90 days; extensions require CISO approval.

Track all exceptions in a central register linked to assets/tags.
## Containers, Images & Build Pipelines
Base Images: Monthly refresh for AMI and container base images (Image Builder/CI).
ECR/Image Scanning: Block deploy on critical vulnerabilities unless approved exception.
Kubernetes/AKS/EKS: Node AMIs patched via rolling Instance Refresh; workloads rebuilt from patched images.

Serverless: Keep runtimes/framework deps current via CI checks.

## Monitoring, KPIs & Reporting
Dashboards: SSM Patch Compliance, AWS Config, Security Hub findings.

KPIs:

% instances compliant by env (target: Prod â‰¥ 95%, Non-Prod â‰¥ 90%).

Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) by severity.
Exposure Days for overdue critical/high.
Failure Rate per patch job.
Alerts: Pager/ChatOps for failed patch jobs, non-compliant critical assets, SSM agent unhealthy.

# Logging, Evidence & Audit
All SSM command invocations, Automation executions, and patch results logged to CloudWatch Logs and S3 with immutability (Object Lock).
Monthly evidence pack: compliance CSV, change records, exception register, and sample host transcripts.

# Identity & Access (Least Privilege)
Instance Role: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore only
Patch Orchestrator Role (example):

# Network & Hardening Requirements
SSM, EC2, Logs VPC endpoints required for Prod.
Outbound egress restricted via NAT/Proxy; allowlists for patch repos (Linux/Windows).
TLS enforced; OS and package manager configs hardened (CIS where applicable).

# Vulnerability Intelligence & Prioritisation
Inputs: AWS Inspector, vendor advisories, CISA KEV, CSIRT alerts.
Prioritise exploitable items and crown-jewel assets first (tag Criticality=High).

# Pre/Post Scripts (Guidance)
Pre: disk check, service status, LB drain, stop non-critical services.
Post: verify processes/ports, run smoke tests, re-register with LB, push summary to ticket.

# Hybrid & Third-Party
On-prem/other cloud hosts registered via SSM Hybrid Activations; same baselines/windows and evidence requirements apply.

# Compliance Mapping (illustrative)
ISO/IEC 27001: A.8.8 (Management of technical vulnerabilities), A.12.6.1.
SOC 2: CC7.1/CC7.2 Change management & vulnerability mgmt.
NIST CSF: PR.IP-12; DE.CM-8.
CIS Controls v8: 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management), 16 (Application Software Security).

# Data Protection & Safety
No secrets in scripts; use Parameter Store/Secrets Manager (KMS-encrypted).
Backups verified before Prod patching; recovery tested quarterly.
Patching must not downgrade crypto or disable security agents.

# Continuous Improvement
Quarterly review of baselines, SLAs, and failure patterns.
Run game days for emergency patching; update runbooks accordingly.
